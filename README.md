### ⚠️Important

This project is under development. The goal is to start with a boilerplate, but transition into a scaffold with various development tools. Many dev tools are here now, but many are yet to come. Examples are the bundle analysis and complexity analysis.

This project can be used right now as a boilerplate, even without the eventual scaffolding features. It is a complete build using all the latest versions of Webpack, Babel and Phaser, and has an idiomatic project structure. Just follow the `Quickly Start` Instrructions!
